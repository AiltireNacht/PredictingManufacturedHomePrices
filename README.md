# Predicting Manufactured Home Prices

## INTRODUCTION
-------
The goal of our project is to predict manufactured housing prices using data from the US Census. The data includes:
1. Region

   This is separated into 4 sections: NorthEast, Northwest, Midwest, South, West each represented by a number 1 - 4
2. Shipmonth

   Written as YYYYMM
3. Square Footage

4. Number of Bedrooms

    This is separated into two categories: 1, if the number of bedrooms is 2 or less, and 2, if the number of bedrooms is 3 or more


K NEAREST NEIGHBOR
How to run the code:
To the run the code, all that you need is the data and press run. 

What the code does:
First the K-NN code trains the algorithm using the training data and the eight nearest neighbors. 
Then we use the algorithm to predict the output for the test data. The accuracy is also calculated by comparing the initial test output to the predicted output. 
The results are then shown using a confusion matrix to compare the accuracy of the test output compared to the predicted output

Meaning of the results:
The results shown in the confusion matrix show that the predicted values are fairly accurate and most of the values were correctly predicted.

RANDOM FOREST
How to run the code:
The only thing you need to run the code is the data. 

What the code does:
First the Random Forest code trains the algorithm using the Random Forest Classifier which uses the training data and labels. 
Then we use the algorithm to predict the output for the test data.
The results are then shown using a confusion matrix to compare the accuracy of the test output compared to the predicted output

Meaning of the results:
The results are shown in a confusion matrix. Most of the data was correctly predicted as you can see in the confusion matrix.
